It requires one frame containing four Aruco tags to create a boundary for operating track area. These tags are used to define a warp matrix to distort future frames to only consider the operating area.\nFrom this area, colours are then sampled to create two images, one with the road-dots (nodes) and another with the intersections. The road-dots have a blob-detector run on them to discretise the positions, then are linked up by considering each point in turn and connecting it to reasonable neighbours, creating a number of connected dots known as path series. The nodes at the end of the path series are then projected further until they collide with a non-zero intersection value, at which point an intersection-node is created and linked up. The final stage is linking up all the nodes into one bidirectional graph (here using NetworkX for some trivial algorithmic processes) which can then be used to pathfind and locate cars upon.",

If the car ever deviates, a new path is calculated to ensure the car knows where it is going at all times.",

Cars then forecasted in how long they would require a Zone to be free, and the creation of subsequent routes would be penalized for requiring the car to wait. If waiting was required, cars then waited for approval from the controller before proceeding.\nHowever, since only one car was ever built, this didn't end up being used.",
